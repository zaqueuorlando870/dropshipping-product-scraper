# Dropshipping Product Scraper

A powerful and easy-to-use Python scraper that extracts product details like images, prices, and descriptions from various e-commerce websites. Designed to help dropshippers quickly gather product information for their stores.

---

## Features

* Scrapes product **images**, **prices**, and **descriptions** from multiple websites
* Uses Selenium WebDriver with Chrome for reliable browser automation
* Easy to customize for different websites by updating scraping rules
* Saves extracted data in a structured format (CSV, JSON, or your choice)
* Helps automate product research and listing for dropshipping

---

## Requirements

* Python 3.7 or higher
* Google Chrome browser installed
* ChromeDriver compatible with your Chrome version
* Python packages:

  * `selenium`
  * `pandas` (optional, for data handling)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dropshipping-product-scraper.git
cd dropshipping-product-scraper
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (macOS/Linux)**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

*On Windows, use:*

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install required Python packages**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Download ChromeDriver**

* Visit [ChromeDriver downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
* Download the version matching your Chrome browser
* Place the `chromedriver` executable in your system PATH or project folder

---

## Usage

1. **Configure scraping rules**

* Open the main script (e.g., `scraper.py`)
* Update the URLs and CSS selectors/XPaths according to the target websites
* Customize data extraction logic as needed

2. **Run the scraper**

```bash
python scraper.py
```

3. **Output**

* The scraped product data (images, prices, descriptions) will be saved to a CSV or JSON file (configurable)
* Screenshots or logs may also be generated depending on your setup

---

## How It Works

* The scraper launches a Chrome browser instance via Selenium WebDriver
* Navigates to product pages on target websites
* Extracts required data fields by locating elements on the page
* Downloads product images and saves URLs or files locally
* Compiles all data into a structured dataset for further use

---

## Customization

* Add or modify website-specific scraping logic in the script
* Use CSS selectors or XPath to target elements uniquely
* Adjust wait times or handle dynamic content loading with Selenium waits
* Extend functionality to save data in different formats or databases

---

## Troubleshooting

* **ChromeDriver version mismatch:** Make sure your ChromeDriver version matches your Chrome browser version exactly
* **Element not found errors:** Verify and update CSS selectors/XPaths since websites often change their structure
* **Timeouts:** Adjust Selenium wait times for slow-loading pages
* **Permission errors:** Run with appropriate permissions or specify correct paths
